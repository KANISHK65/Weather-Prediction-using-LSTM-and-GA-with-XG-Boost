# Weather-Prediction-using-LSTM-and-GA-with-XG-Boost
This project uses regression models to estimate missing weather data and employs an optimized LSTM, tuned via a genetic algorithm, to forecast short- to medium-term conditions. LSTM captures sequential patterns, while XGBoost refines predictions in a hybrid model for improved accuracy.
